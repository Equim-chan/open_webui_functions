## Open WebUI Introduction

**Introduction:**

Open WebUI is a self-hostable, community-driven, and locally focused web interface designed to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs). Built with a Svelte-based front-end and a Python (FastAPI) backend, Open WebUI aims to provide a user-friendly and customizable experience for running and managing LLMs, particularly in local or self-hosted environments.  Open WebUI can be extended using a plugin system. See the [Plugin Documentation](plugins.md) for more information.

**Key Features:**

*   **User Interface:** The Svelte-based front-end offers a responsive and intuitive interface for interacting with LLMs. It provides features such as:
    *   Chat history management
    *   Model selection
    *   Parameter tuning (temperature, top\_p, etc.)
    *   Feature toggles (web search, image generation, code interpreter)
    *   User settings and customization options
*   **Backend Architecture:** The FastAPI backend handles the core logic of the application, including:
    *   API endpoint management
    *   Authentication and authorization
    *   Model management (listing, access control)
    *   LLM service integration (Ollama, OpenAI API, etc.)
    *   Request pre-processing and response post-processing
*   **LLM Integration:** Open WebUI supports various LLM backends, including:
    *   Ollama (for local LLM execution)
    *   OpenAI API (for cloud-based LLM access)
    *   Potentially other LLM services through API integration
*   **Features:** Open WebUI offers a range of features to enhance the LLM interaction experience:
    *   **Web Search:** Integrates web search results into the LLM's context for more informed responses.
    *   **Image Generation:** Enables the LLM to generate images based on user prompts.
    *   **Code Interpreter:** Allows the LLM to execute code and incorporate the results into its responses.
*   **Self-Hosting:** Open WebUI is designed for self-hosting, allowing users to run the application on their own hardware or cloud infrastructure, providing greater control over their data and privacy.
*   **Community-Driven:** Open WebUI is a community-driven project, with contributions from developers and users around the world.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Front-end:** Svelte, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
*   **Database:** (Inferred - likely a relational database or NoSQL database for storing chat history, user data, and plugin configurations)
*   **Communication:** WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication between the front-end and backend.
