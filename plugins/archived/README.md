# Archived Plugins

Functions here are discontinued, I'm not developing them anymore.

## Plugins and Scripts

-   `smallthinker_filter.py` | At first I wanted to code a simple filter that makes output of the `smallthinker:3b` nicer but now I'm thinking of turning it into more general reasoning model formatter.
-   `thinking_gemini.py` | [Open WebUI Community](https://openwebui.com/f/suurt8ll/thinking_gemini) | An outdated script, initially developed for `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp` model interactions. Superseded by `gemini_manifold.py`.
